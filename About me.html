                   My name is Htet Myet Nyein. You have probably noticed it since it is the name of the website. I was born in Yangon, Myanmar. I am 21 years old and currently living in NayPyiTaw, the capital of Myanmar. Both my prarents were government workers until my father retired 7 years ago. Due to them being government workers, I had to move along with them to several cities across Myanmar. In 2021, when Myanmar was in complete chaos, I was in Loikaw, Kayah. I lived there for two years, surrounded by heavy artileries and constant bombing. I even had to evacuate the city in 2023. But this makes me realize how fragile life can be and encouraged me to chase my dreams regardless of the situation.

                  <p class = "about-me-paragraph-1">
                   In 2025, I am in NayPyiTaw, after moving to three different cities, from Loikaw to Mandalay, from Mandalay to Yangon and from Yangon to NayPyiTaw. In March 28, I was once again showned how lives can be taken within minutes. A devastating earthquake destroyed my house. I was inside the house and saw how violent nature can be at times. But my determination to chase my dreams became more solid.
