                      I’m currently living in a suburban area of Nay Pyi Taw with my parents and a few of my mom’s coworkers. My mother works for the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement. Until recently, we lived in a government-provided apartment. However, on March 28, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck and severely damaged the building. After staying in a temporary camp for several months, we relocated here in July.

                        These days, I spend most of my time learning computer programming, mathematics, and physics as I prepare to apply for a scholarship in Engineering—specifically in Mechanical or Mechatronics Engineering. Since I don’t want to place a financial burden on my mom by enrolling in paid courses, I’ve been using free platforms like Khan Academy and freeCodeCamp. I am also working on small solo projects to sharpen my skills in coding, math, and physics, and to explore ideas in philosophy that interest me.

                        To give you a small break from reading, here’s a photo of a small farm I’ve been helping out with recently—it’s one of the things that keeps me grounded and helps me stay active.

                      <h4>(2) Educational Background</h4>
                      <p>
                        I graduated from high school in 2020 with three distinctions — in Math, Chemistry, and Biology — a year before the political chaos in my country. Due to that unrest, I couldn’t attend any university and became trapped in a city surrounded by armed conflict. I decided to use my time there effectively and began my programming journey through freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design courses.
                      <div id="more-text" class="hidden-text">
                        <p>
                          After relocating to another city, I realized that scholarships were my only path to pursue my dream of becoming an inventor. So, I started preparing for the IELTS and achieved a band score of 8.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I then began applying for scholarships, but I wasn’t selected. Determined to demonstrate my potential, I decided to showcase my skills through various projects and shifted my focus to Python, Math, and Physics. freeCodeCamp became like a classroom for my Python journey, where I completed multiple courses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I am also interested in philosophy and have written a few pieces, which I uploaded on this website’s Projects page.
