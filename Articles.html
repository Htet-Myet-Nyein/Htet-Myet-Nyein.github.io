                <h3>The start of a relationship and when it settled down</h3>
                <p>(This article is written originally in Burmese. I translated it using Google Gemini. I would later translate on my own.)</p>
                <p>(An
exploratory essay on philosophy without
references.)</p>
                <p>Almost all human
relationships start with excitement and
dynamism, but as they settle down,
disagreements begin to arise. These
disagreements almost always lead to
arguments and fights. Because this tends
to follow a predictable pattern, it is
commonly accepted that "real friends are
made only after a fight." I see three
reasons why this phenomenon occurs.</p>
               <div id="more-text" class="hidden-text">
                <p>(1) Self-Control</p>
                <p>When interacting with
someone we are unfamiliar with, we mostly
restrain ourselves, not openly expressing
our desires and opinions. Similarly, the
person we are interacting with is also
controlling their mind, just like us. Most
of the feelings we hold back are often
self-serving. Since both parties restrain
most of their ego-based desires, their egos
do not clash, and every meeting tends to go
smoothly.</p>   
                <p>However, once they become
close, both parties tend to prioritize
their own needs in their interactions,
giving rise to many disagreements. What
most people wonder at this point is why
these disagreements happen, even though they
feel they haven't done anything wrong.</p>
                <p>(2) Understanding Others' Minds</p>
                <p>When two strangers meet,
after the usual greetings, they exchange
views. They share thoughts and ideas under
various topics. The thoughts and views that
are expressed and exchanged, even if not
complete (due to factor number (1) mentioned
above), usually share a general concept.
At this stage, they are understanding, even
if their dispositions don't align or their
ways of thinking are different. They tend
to suppress the desire to object, so the
capacity for understanding is quite high,
and conversations between the two are often
smooth. They are also tolerant of each
other's potential habits and characteristics.</p>
                <p>After becoming close, however,
one side wants the other person to agree
with and see things the way they do. If the
other person doesn't see it that way, they
want to object and argue. They gradually
forget that differences in ways of thinking
and in personal habits and characteristics
are possible, and problems begin to arise
between people whose views do not align.</p>
                <p>(3) Protecting the Relationship</p>
                <p>People engage in the
first two actions because they do not want
to damage the relationship between them.
They carefully manage everything, starting
from the smallest action or word, and take
time to consider whether something is good
or bad, appropriate or inappropriate. They
are very careful that the relationship does
not break down, tending to watch over it
constantly, like cultivating a sapling.</p>
                <p>But as they become closer,
they tend to release their inhibitions more
and more, and they even start competing
over who values the relationship more. They
misjudge the strength of the relationship
and start to neglect small disagreements,
neither resolving them nor apologizing.</p>
                <p>So, should we continue to
nurture the attitudes we had at the start
of a relationship, even in the middle, the
"settled" period? Or is this just wearing
a "mask," concealing our true selves for
the sake of others, and should be avoided?
Is fighting a "social relationship test"
because only without the "mask" can we
find a friend who truly suits us?</p>

                <h3>The expected reactions</h3>
                <p>(This article is written originally in Burmese. I translated it using Google Gemini. I would later translate on my own.)</p>
                <p>In human social
interactions within a community, there are
responses that people consciously or
unconsciously expect to receive from one
another. Although no one explicitly states
these expectations, their absence can lead
to friction in relationships. Conversely,
the degree to which we can fulfill these
unspoken expectations indicates how smoothly
our own relationships are progressing. Dale
Carnegie, in his book How to Win Friends
and Influence People, states that "everything
we do springs from a desire to be great."
These small responses are the things that
boost that desire to feel important.</p>
                <div id="more-text" class="hidden-text">
                <p>For instance, when we
meet a stranger, we subconsciously want some
kind of response from them, such as a smile,
a friendly greeting, or an offer of a seat.
When they fail to offer any of these, we
often feel a sense of awkwardness or
discomfort, don't we? Because their lack
of attention seems to crush our inner sense
of self-importance, we become displeased
and frustrated.</p>
                <p>This is not only true
when dealing with strangers but also among
family members. Within a family, even if
we simply do a household chore, we desire
recognition from other family members. Since
this recognition is often not given, we end
up suppressing the other person's "sense of
self-importance and respect." The words most
commonly heard from mothers in Myanmar
households, such as "I'm just like a slave,"
arise because we fail to soothe or respond
to their household competence with words
or actions.</p>
                <p>So, what do I mean by
these "responses"? I mean all the things we
do back in return, such as smiles, words,
gestures, and actions. This refers to things
like showing consideration to someone who
is expecting consideration, expressing thanks
to someone expecting gratitude, or giving
sincere praise when praise is due. Most people
who have smooth and successful relationships
are skilled at doing these things.</p>
                <p>To be able to do this,
however, is not easy: first, one must set
aside their pride; second, one must
understand the other person's feelings and
be able to think for them; third, one must
be able to restrain and swallow some of
their own thoughts and opinions; and
fourth, one must be able to change their
own mindset. In short, it is about
prioritizing others over oneself. However,
this, in turn, seems to contradict the 21st
century's philosophy of prioritizing the self.</p>
